# Project 245. Actor-critic implementation
# Description:
# The Actor-Critic method combines the strengths of policy-based (actor) and value-based (critic) approaches.

# The Actor decides which action to take.

# The Critic evaluates how good the action was (i.e., estimates the value function).

# This setup reduces variance in policy gradients (like REINFORCE) and enables more stable learning. In this project, we’ll implement a basic Actor-Critic agent for CartPole-v1.

# 🧪 Python Implementation (Actor-Critic with PyTorch for CartPole):
# Install required packages:
# pip install gym torch numpy matplotlib
 
import gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
# Define Actor-Critic network (shared base)

# ✅ What It Does:
# Learns both the policy (actor) and value function (critic) simultaneously.

# Reduces the variance of policy updates by guiding them with critic estimates.

# Performs more stable and efficient learning than basic REINFORCE.
